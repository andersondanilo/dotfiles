"""
A script for Polybar which listens to an MPRIS-compatible media player's
events and outputs the current playback status, i.e., the current track.

This rudimentary quick-and-dirty script should only be temporary since a
native MPRIS/Playerctl module for Polybar is planned for the near future.

Required Python packages:
  - PyGObject (https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
Required applications:
  - playerctl (https://github.com/acrisci/playerctl)
